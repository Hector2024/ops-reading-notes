# Hectors Reading notes


## Ops Readings


### Group Policy

1. Why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying

- Compliance is important when it comes to security in general. How do you know something or someone is working correctly if you do not check?

1. How would you convince your future company to pursue SOC2 compliance?

- I would tell them it is cheaper in the long run to make sure compliance is followed even if that means spending upfront. It will be cheaper if we are proactive instead of reactive. It will also send customers a good message to know that we take compliance seriously. Especially if we have SaaS.

2. What are the five SOC2 Trust Principles?

- Privacy
- Security
- Availability
- Processing Integrity
- Confidentiality

3. How would your explain the three levels of the SOC2 pyramid in an analogy your friends or former colleagues would understand?

- It is a simple 3 step process for documentation: policies, procedures, and proof of what you did and its success/implementation. in simpler terms you want to have guidelines of what you do, documentation of how to do those things, and proof that those things where indeed done.

## Things I want to know more about

- What other compliance guides are out there?
- How do you become a compliance specialist?
- I know every bbusiness should need compliance but are there some that do not?
