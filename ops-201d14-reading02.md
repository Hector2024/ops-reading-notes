## Ops Readings

### Reading #1


1. Why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module

- It seems like bash is everywhere and that we will be using it to complete the assignments we have coming up in this course along with the courses we have coming up.

2. What is the primary function of a shell in a computer’s operating system?

- A shell in a compter’s OS is to run other applications through commands/CLI.

3. How does Bash locate and execute commands on a Linux or Unix system?

- Bash looks through your directories and if the command exists then it will execute it.

4. How can you determine if your system is running a Bash shell?

- You will the CLI you are working on and run the command “echo $0” which will respond with bash if you are running it.

5. What makes Bash scripting powerful and why is it considered scriptable?

- Bash is considered “Scriptable” because you can write commands out in a plain text file and have bash run it (or read from a script!). Bash scripting is powerful because you can set it and forget it instead of being involved at every step when writing commands.

6. Bash scripting allows for customization, automation, and efficiency. Discuss methods or practices from your previous work experience or cultural background that aim to achieve similar goals in daily tasks.

- I can not think of any automations off the top of my head with my old work but I feel like accounting work would be easier if you knew bash. You could automate adding numbers and save time.
