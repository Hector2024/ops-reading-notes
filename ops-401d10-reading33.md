### Threat Hunting with Security Onion

1. Why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying

- Knowing the difference between threat hunting and other measures in place for our systems is crucial so we know how and where we stand when an attack occurs.

2. How are Threat Hunting and Pentesting different?

- Threat hunting is a proactive action of looking for signs of compromise in our systems and Pentesting is when people we know and trust test our systems for vulnerabilities so that we may patch them.

3. What is the primary objective of Threat Hunting?

- The primary objective of threat hunting is to proactively find and stop unknown or undetected threats in our system.

4. Your organization has a fully functioning SOC but not active Threat Hunting. How would you advocate for your security organization to start Threat Hunting activities?

- Threat hunting is another layer of defense we can add. Defense in the form of offense, we already have reactive measures in place but with a proactive measure like threat hunting we could find and eliminate threats that we did not know where there and possibly stop a bigger plan from forming or from being executed saving us time, money, and our companies public opinion.
