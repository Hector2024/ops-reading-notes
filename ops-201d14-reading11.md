1. Why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying

- 
2. What are some common indicators that an SSD may be failing?
    
-  Although it is not as noticeable since they do not display error codes you can tell by: 
     - "Bad blocks" which means that the data storage and retrieval functions are impeded.
     - "File system repair. If a computer or file system requires repair but physical defect software shows no damage" (N-able, August 2019)
     - "Crashing. If a computer crashes while booting up but seems to work normally after several reboots, the SSD is probably failing." (N-able, August 2019)
     - "Read-only mode. While somewhat less common, it is possible for SSDs to cease functioning except in read-only mode." (N-able, August 2019)
    
3. How do SSD failures differ from HDD failures in terms of detectability?
    
- HDDs emit audible signals like whirring, clicking or humming.   
    
4. What are bad blocks in an SSD, and how do they affect its performance?

- "Bad blocks" which means that the data storage and retrieval functions are impeded.

5. How can power cycling an SSD help resolve certain issues?

- Power cycling can help when an SSD becomes corrupted through power failure.

6. How might this topic be relevant in the aftermath of a natural disaster? Describe how individuals or communities can use these techniques to recover data and resume their normal activities.

- The communities and people can use these techniques to try and recover their data if they need to. It is also a good source to help do preventive actions like back ups, monitoring tools, and smart purchasing.

## Things I want to know more about

- How often do SSDs fail?
- If the SSD fails can I just replace it and keep the rest of my computer?
- What monitoring tools are the best?
