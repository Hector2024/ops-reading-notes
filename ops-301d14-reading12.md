### Domain Controller

1. Why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying

- We will probably come into contact with a domain controller and it is a good idea to know something about it before touching it.

What is a Windows Domain and How Does It Affect My PC?

1. Explain the role of a Domain Controller?

- "a way to manage a large number of PCs and control them from one place." (Chris Hoffman, AUG2014)

2. What is the benefit of being able to login with the same username and password on any computer joined to the domain? What are the security risks?

- The benifit is ease of access and the downfall or security risk is the same, ease of access.

3. Describe how group policies are used in domains?

- "Each computer on the domain will get these settings from the domain controller and they'll override any local settings users specify on their PCs. All the settings are controlled from a single place. This also "locks down" the computers." (Chris Hoffman, AUG2014)

4. In what other ways can you think of that domains could be used beyond what was presented in the reading?

- It is up to your imagination, if you have controll of everything in your system you can allow or deny, creat or destroy whatever you want within your system.
