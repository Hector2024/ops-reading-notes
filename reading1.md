# Hectors Reading notes

## Ops Readings

### Reading #1

**Why does this matter and how is it related**

- "The Big Hack" (Robertson & Riley, 2018) matters because of the severity and possible damage that happened with this seeding attack. The hackers were able to get into the U.S.  D.O.D. systems and had whatever access they needed. It relates to the class because it explained 2 ways a hack can be performed and how a physical hack can be more difficult but more devastating if pulled off correctly. This article is the beginning of understanding hacks and computers.
  
**Questions**

1. How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?
   - A hardware hack involves making or altering the physical part of a system to gain access. While a software hack happens with no alteration to the physical system, they try tricking/exploiting the software, and it is usually cheaper and can be done from a distance.


2. What are the two ways for spies to alter a computer’s hardware?
   - "Interdiction consists of manipulating devices as they’re in transit from manufacturer to customer." (Robertson & Riley, 2018)

   - "seeding attack is developing a deep understanding of a product’s design, manipulating components at the factory, and ensuring that the doctored devices made it through the global logistics chain to the desired location" (Robertson & Riley, 2018)

3. Explain how the hack worked.
   - They used the Seeding tactic to hack into their intended targets. They inserted a "tiny microchip, not much bigger than a grain of rice, that wasn’t part of the boards’ original design" (Robertson & Riley, 2018) during the manufacturing process. "The implant was placed on the board in a way that allowed it to effectively edit this information queue, injecting its own code or altering the order of the instructions the CPU was meant to follow." (Robertson & Riley, 2018)

4. How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?
   - Amazon web services "hired a third-party company to scrutinize Elemental’s security" (Robertson & Riley, 2018), and then "In late spring of 2015, Elemental’s staff boxed up several servers and sent them to Ontario, Canada, for the third-party security company to test" (Robertson & Riley, 2018) that is when they found the chip that was attached to the motherboard that was not part of the original design. AWS then reported the findings to the U.S. authorities who conducted their own investigation and found that "The chips had been inserted during the manufacturing process." (Robertson & Riley, 2018) Although physical hacks do more damage they are also easier to track due to the real-world physical evidence they leave. "In order to get further down the trail, U.S. spy agencies drew on the prodigious tools at their disposal. They sifted through communications intercepts, tapped informants in Taiwan and China, even tracked key individuals through their phones, Eventually they traced the malicious chips to four subcontracting factories that had been building Supermicro motherboards for at least two years." (Robertson & Riley, 2018) The trail eventually ended when they caught people impersonating a Supermicro rep or a person of power in connection to the government who would either bribe or threaten the company with an inspection that would lead to a company shutdown. "The investigators concluded that this intricate scheme was the work of a People’s Liberation Army unit specializing in hardware attacks" (Robertson & Riley, 2018)

   - It help me understand the 2 types of hacks and was what I quoted a lot through out my reading assignment.

  ## Things I want to know more about
  - Has there been any updates on the companies that were affected?
  - Did the companies OFFICIALLY come out and say there was a problem?
  - Apart from losing money/customers why would they not admit the hack happened?
