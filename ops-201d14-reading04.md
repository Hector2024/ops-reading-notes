# Hectors Reading notes

## Ops Readings

### Reading #4

1. Why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying


- It is important to have a troubleshooting plan/guide and to document. Since we are learning about being a help desk tech and we will be troubleshooting it is good to have a plan.


2. What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?


- The first thing you do is collect information and get organized. Ask the user when the problem started, how long it has been going on, and what happened before, during, and after, the problem itself. Then you make theories on what it could be.


3. What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?


- After one successful solution we implement the fix! Now some fixes can be applied right then and others at a certain time depending on customer needs. You also need to test the fix to ensure it really did take care of the issue.


4. What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?


- The benefits to documentation are that you or another tech could go back if they find themselves in the same situation and implement those steps because you documented them! it not only will help you but others as well


5. Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?


- Well if you identify the issue with the device and can implement it then the user needs to go pray or they have family coming or they may not want it at the moment due to a holiday. You would have to be understanding and schedule another time to come back and take care of the issue. That way the customer feels heard, helped, seen, and understood.


## Things I want to know more about


- How many help desk guides/plans are there
- Is compTIA always the best?
- Are there websites where help desk techs go to put their stuff so others can see?
