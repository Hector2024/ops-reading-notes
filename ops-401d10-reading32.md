3. What are the six steps of the Malware Analysis process? Whatâ€™s a good mnemonic you can use to remember it?

- Capture the malware, build a malware lab, install your tools, record the basline, commence your investigation, document the results

4. You are tasked with analyzing a new malware sample. Which type of malware analysis would you conduct first and why?

- I would do manual, static, dynamic, and then automated. I would do manual first to see what the malware is supposed to do and what it is going to affect, then id move to static to creat a quick indicator of compromise form, then i would do dynamic to see what it does in action and if my findings from the manual analysis where accurate and complete, lastly i would do an automated to see if there is anything i missed and need to dig deeper on.

## Things I want to know more about

- Is there a better tool for malware analysis?
