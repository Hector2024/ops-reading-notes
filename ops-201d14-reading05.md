# Hectors Reading notes


## Ops Readings


### Reading #5


1. Why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying


   - In most cases when being at a help desk or anywhere else in the world you are bound to run into a windows operating system. So it would be helpful to know some microsoft cmd tools.


2. How can you list the files in the current directory using the command prompt?


   - Running the command 'dir' in the command prompt will give you a list of the files and subdirectories in the directory


3. How might the “sfc” command and the “gpupdate” command help in troubleshooting on Windows?


   - The 'sfc' command will help to check for and repair any broken or corrupted files.
   - The 'gpupdate' is used to force a group policy update hence gpupdate.
   - With both of those commands you can troubleshoot windows if a file needs repair or if a certain system needs an update.


4. What advantages does the “robocopy” command offer over the “xcopy” command, and why is it useful for file transfers in certain situations?
   
   - The biggest benefit of using robocopy as opposed to xcopy is that the copy will resume if it is interrupted so you don't have to worry about restarting it.


5. Think about any real-life scenarios from your cultural context where the use of command line tools could be beneficial. Describe one such scenario and explain how a specific command line tool would help address the situation.


   - I don't come from a tech savvy background and I cannot think of when I could have used any command tools. The furthest my family goes is using apple maps. However I could use the command prompt to help me troubleshoot any computers my family has from a distance.


## Things I want to know more about


   - Why isn't there a centralized language for the every CLI
