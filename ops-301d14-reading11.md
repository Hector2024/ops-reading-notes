### Windows Server

1. Why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying

- It is important to know the difference between the server version and the everyday desktop Windows.

What’s the Difference Between Windows and Windows Server?

1. What is a server, and how is it different from a regular computer? How would you describe this difference to a friend who doesn’t know much about computers?

- A server is something that has resources that you can access and a regular computer is what you would use in an everyday office job. Think of a filing cabinet when you need to put away or get a file you go to the filing cabinet. The same thing would be done in a file server. You go to the file server using your computer and get or save a file.

2. How does the way Windows Server receives updates differ from Windows Home and Pro?

- The server has had a disable update feature which the computer will get a pause update feature. Updates also come faster and more often for the servers as opposed to the desktop windows.

3. Does Windows Server have different hardware requirements than Windows Home or Pro?

- Yes and no. You can give it the same hardware as a regular computer but that would be pointless, servers are meant to be stronger and faster due to more accessing them at the same time.
