## Data Protection: Data In transit vs. Data At Rest

1. From your day to day computer use, provide examples of when data is at rest and when it is in transit.

- Data at rest are things like a file you saved. It does not do anything and it waits until it is needed. Or a video game file, it stays doing nothing until you play again and over write it.

2. Explain the role data encryption with regards to the CIA triad.

- data encryption falls within the Confidentiality of the cia triad. You want what is in that file protected for a number of reasons but either way you want to protect what is inside from people who do not need to see it.

## Things I want to know more about

- Can people get a job protecting data at rest?
