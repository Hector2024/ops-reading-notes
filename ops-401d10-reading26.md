# Hectors Reading notes

## Ops Readings

### Remote Code Execution

1. Why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying

- Know what a threat analyst does and what powershell is capable of doing are very important for cyber security and need to be studied.

2. You just got a new job as a Cyber Threat Analyst, how would you explain your role to a family member?

- The role of a Cyber Threat Analyst is to know, understand, and be on gaurd for internet threats.

3. Explain what makes PowerShell such an effective attack vector.

- "Attackers can use fileless malware to get around these safeguards by injecting payloads into running applications or by utilizing scripting. PowerShell is an ideal channel for delivering these attacks because of its wide deployment and access to all parts of a host via the .NET framework. Additionally, it is easy to develop scripts applicable for payload delivery, and because PowerShell is a trusted application, it will almost always be allowed to execute scripts with impunity." (TrendMicro, June 2020)

4. What are two things you can do to mitigate attacks that leverage PowerShell?

- "being able to track its activities, finding the deobfuscated events and payloads, monitoring, and getting used to their behaviors are skills that can be learned and developed." (TrendMicro, June 2020)

## Things I want to know more about

- Being able to track and stop are 2 different things. Is there no stopping powershell without disabling it?
- Can living off the land be done in anything else?
