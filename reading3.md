## Ops Readings

### Reading #3

1. Why does it matter and how does it relate?

- Knowing what the BIOS and the CMOS are helps with the understanding of how a computer works and what its components are. It relates to what we are learning because we should know some of the basics of computer components and what their purpose is if we are going to continue in this field.


2. What is the BIOS? Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process.

- BIOS is "software on hardware" (Learn Computer Science, 2023) that helps the hardware communicate with your operating system to help the computer turn on and run correctly.   
It also runs some tests and helps the hardware start upon turning on. 

- It is like waking up in the morning, getting ready, and getting to work where you will start your day. The BIOS is all the things you do to get ready before getting to work. Waking up, brushing your teeth, changing, eating, driving, etc. 
 
3. What is the “Power On Self-Test”?

- It is the initial test to make sure the key components are present and functioning 

4. What is the CMOS?

- CMOS "Is a type of technology used to produce integrated chips. In computer architecture, the CMOS chip is used to store critical data used by the operating system during the booting process."  (Learn Computer Science, 2023)

5. What is the CMOS battery?

- A CMOS battery is there to give the CMOS power in order to store data when the computer is turned off

## Things I want to know more about

- Can I replace the CMOS battery while the PU is on in order to not lose data?

- How do I know when the battery is low?

- What kind of personalization settings can I make in BIOS?
