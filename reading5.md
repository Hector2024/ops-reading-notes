# Hectors Reading notes

## Ops Readings

### Reading #5 

1. why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module.

- This topic matters and relates because we are about to start working with command prompts. Knowing some of the history and how to be comfortable in the program is a big step in becoming fluid in it.

2. Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?

- "shell", "terminal", and "command prompt" mean the same thing. It is a text interface to the computer.
- They are used for the power, flexibility, speed and efficiency the the command prompt allows for and not everything has a GUI.
  
3. What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?

- "to change directories (cd), another to list their contents (ls), a third to rename or move files (mv)" (Canonical, 2023)

4. What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?

- "using “/” at the start of your path means “starting from the root directory”." (Canonical, 2023)
- "Using the tilde character (”~”) at the start of your path similarly means “starting from my home directory”." (Canonical, 2023)

5. Explain what Linux is, using anything except English.


## Things I want to know more about

- Is there someone where i can practice using the command prompt without fear of messing up my computer?
- How long does it usually take someone to get a handle on using the terminal?
- What kind of things can be done on the terminal?
