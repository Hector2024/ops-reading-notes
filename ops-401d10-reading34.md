### Forensics Investigation with Autopsy

1. Why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying

- Forensic investigation is another layer of defense. Learning how to investigate or what it is for can bring you closer to holding someone accountable for their actions.

2. What are the main differences between computer forensics and cybersecurity?

>- While they often intersect, computer forensics and cybersecurity are two different domains. Cybersecurity primarily focuses on preventing and mitigating cybercrime by optimizing an organization’s security protocols. By contrast, computer forensic professionals concentrate on extracting files, data, or information from digital devices, cloud platforms, or wireless networks. While they often support cybersecurity efforts, their work is not confined only to cybercrime investigations. And while both fields involve similar educational paths, there are different job responsibilities and titles associated with the two fields.
