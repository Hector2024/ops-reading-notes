1. Why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying

- This topic matters because we learn to use another one of windows tool which will come in helpful later. Also getting familiar with something else windows has to offer is never a bad idea.

2. What is the Windows Registry, and what does it store?

- The Windows registry is a collection of databases ans it stores user settings which it does in the form of keys and values.

3. What are the two types of registry settings stored for each Windows user account?

- programs configuration settings and user specific settings.

4. What are “registry hacks” and why might someone want to use them?

- Registry hacks are tweaks you make to the registry.

5. What are some common tasks you can perform by editing the Windows Registry?

- Displaying a message at Sign in, stop users from shutting down your PC, Block users from using a certain app.

6. Imagine you’re explaining the concept of the Windows Registry to someone who has never used a computer before. How would you make this explanation culturally relevant and relatable to their life experiences or background?

- I would say that Windows registry is a different kind of settings editor for programs, as 2 people can have different settings for a program you can make it so they all have the same one. You could use this if you were teaching a computer class and needed every person to have the same settings or if you wanted to display a customized welcome sign.

## Things I want to know more about

- Are there sites dedicated to .reg files?
- What other cool things can be done?
- What is the difference in blocking a app through the firewall instead of through the registry.
