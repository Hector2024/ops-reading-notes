### Traffic Mirroring

1. Why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying

- The best part of a defense is to be proactive not reactive. If you monitor your traffic you will be able to see attacks before they get worse.

#### How to capture network traffic? SPAN vs TAP

1. What are the differences between SPAN and TAP?

- SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer): Port monitoring is when you forward a copy of each packet both incoming and out going to another port where your monitoring device is. Which means you can monitor remotely.

- "A network TAP (Terminal Access Point) is a hardware device which can passively capture traffic on a network. It is commonly used to monitor the traffic between two points in the network. If the network between these two points consists of a physical cable, a network TAP may be the best way to capture traffic." (Boris Rogier, June 2016)

2. What types of network devices can support network traffic mirroring?

- Switchs, routers, firewalls

3. How can network traffic mirroring be used for network security?

- You can use it to keep logs and use it for the Accounting part in the AAA.

4. Are there any legal or ethical considerations when using network traffic mirroring?

- I mean yes and no, people are entitled to privcy but if it is your network and your gear I think you are entitled to know what is going on in it. I do believe there is a fine line between monitoring and snooping though.

## Things I want to know more about

- Are there certs for monitoring?
